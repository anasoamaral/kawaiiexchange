## About
  ðŸŽ€Kawaii exchangeðŸŽ€ is a web application that consists of a âœ¨girlyâœ¨ exchange calculator. Technologies used are embedded JavaScript (EJS), Express.JS, Node.JS, axios and the body-parser middleware. 
  
  For some parts of the CSS, the [NES.css] framework is used to give it a retro style. 
  
  The exchange rate source is the [ExchangeRate-API].
